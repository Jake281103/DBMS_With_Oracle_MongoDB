# 🗄️ DBMS with Oracle & MongoDB

This project showcases hands-on implementation of database management concepts using two database systems: **Oracle** (RDBMS) and **MongoDB** (NoSQL). It highlights the design, creation, and manipulation of structured and unstructured data, providing a comparative learning experience in relational and non-relational databases.

## 🎯 Objective

To demonstrate key DBMS operations using both Oracle SQL and MongoDB:
- Schema design and normalization in Oracle
- Document structure and aggregation in MongoDB
- CRUD operations and advanced queries in both systems
- Understanding the strengths and use cases of RDBMS vs NoSQL

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Oracle SQL Developer** – for relational database modeling and SQL queries  
- **MongoDB Community Edition** – for NoSQL document-based operations  
- **MongoDB Compass** – for visual data exploration  
- **SQL (DDL/DML/DCL)** – for schema creation, data manipulation, and user control  
- **MongoDB Query Language (MQL)** – for working with collections and documents  


## 🔍 Key Features

### Oracle:
- Table creation with primary and foreign keys
- Use of constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK)
- SQL queries including `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `HAVING`
- Data normalization up to 3NF

### MongoDB:
- Document insertion and collection setup
- Querying nested documents and arrays
- Aggregation pipelines and filtering
- Comparison with SQL equivalents

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Understand the core differences between SQL and NoSQL models
- Learn to design efficient data schemas in relational and document databases
- Practice data extraction and analysis using both structured and semi-structured formats
- Gain hands-on experience with two widely used DBMS platforms
